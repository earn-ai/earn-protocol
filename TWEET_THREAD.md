# Earn Protocol Launch Tweet Thread

## Tweet 1 (Main announcement)
🚀 Introducing Earn Protocol

Tokenomics-as-a-service for Solana.

One API call gives your Pump.fun token:
• Staking rewards
• Automated buybacks  
• Creator revenue sharing

No smart contracts needed. Live on mainnet.

🔗 earn.supply

## Tweet 2 (The problem)
99% of Pump.fun tokens fail.

Why? No utility. No reason to hold. Creators dump, holders get rugged.

We fix that with built-in tokenomics that align creator and holder incentives.

---

## Tweet 3 (How it works)
How it works:

1. Launch token via API (30 seconds)
2. Trading fees accumulate automatically
3. Fees split: Creator + Stakers + Buybacks
4. Stakers earn passive SOL income
5. Buybacks reduce sell pressure

Positive flywheel. Everyone wins.

## Tweet 4 (Templates)
Four tokenomics templates:

🎰 Degen: 40% creator, 30% stakers
🎨 Creator: 50% creator, 25% stakers  
🏛️ Community: 25% creator, 50% stakers
💎 Low-fee: 20% creator, 70% stakers

Pick what fits your project.
